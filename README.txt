README: Understanding the Dynamics of Audio Classification in Command Recognition

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of training an audio classification model for recognizing speech commands. Using a dataset of speech commands, the goal is to create a machine learning model that can classify different speech commands from audio files, with a focus on handling speech-related features such as waveforms and Mel spectrograms. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective for handling the sequential nature of audio data.

Project Structure
The repository contains the following sections:

- Data Exploration: The dataset used consists of several speech commands (e.g., "bed", "cat", "tree", "house", etc.). In this section, we explore the dataset by analyzing the distribution of files, the duration of recordings, and visualizing audio features.

- Preprocessing: Audio files are loaded and preprocessed for training. We ensure that all audio samples are of consistent length, and extract relevant features such as waveforms and Mel spectrograms.

- Model Architecture: A CNN model is built using Keras to process the preprocessed audio data. The model uses several convolutional layers followed by dense layers and dropout regularization for classification.

- Training and Evaluation: The model is trained using the preprocessed audio data and evaluated on a validation set. The training and validation loss/accuracy are plotted to monitor the performance of the model.


Dataset
This project utilizes the Synthetic Speech Commands Dataset (augmented version), which contains audio recordings of various spoken words. The dataset includes different classes like "cat", "bed", "tree", etc., and each word is represented by multiple audio samples in WAV format. The dataset is organized in subdirectories, each corresponding to a different speech command. The audio files are sampled at a rate of 16,000 Hz and preprocessed to 8,000 Hz before training.


Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Librosa
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn


This project demonstrates the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for audio classification, particularly in the context of speech command recognition. The model can be further refined and tested on new datasets for broader applications in speech-to-text and voice assistant technologies.
